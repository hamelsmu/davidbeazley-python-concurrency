Notes

- with threads, stay away from CPU bound work, or they will compete with other threads
- for cpu bound work, offload to a sub - process so you are not competing with the thread.
-  two threads have interleaving access to a single shared object, overwriting each otherâ€™s results. Similar race conditions can arise when one thread frees memory or closes a file handle before the other thread is finished accessing it.
- The operating system can swap which thread is running at any time. A thread can be swapped out after any of these small instructions. This means that a thread can be put to sleep to let another thread run in the middle of a Python statement.

Coroutines don't run themselves, something has to run them.
